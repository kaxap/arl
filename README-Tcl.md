As TCP protocols were initially designed for wired networks, so they are not able to deliver optimized performance, in the case of ad-hoc networks. For ensuring a reliable transfer, various variants of TCP must be used such as TCP-Reno, TCP-Vegas, TCP-Westwood, TCP-New Reno, TCP-Tahoe, TCP-Sack etc. Mobile ad-hoc network is a decentralized network consisting of various mobile nodes. Challenges in MANETS routing includes lack of apriori knowledge of underlying topology, which requires using the adaptive protocol to tackle route failures and packet loss scenarios. |
