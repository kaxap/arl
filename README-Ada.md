| 2 | 0 | 0 | 7 years ago | [NameMap](https://github.com/bracke/NameMap)/999 | NameMapper scans a directory for ada sourcefiles (both body and specifications) and creates the file gnat.adc containing a pragma Source_File_Name for every file with a name longer than 10 characters. NameMap does not search all files for compilation units, it simply assumes that the package name and the filename are identical.  Why is that useful ? Well, the current RISCOS port of GNAT (The GNU Ada translator) can only handle filenames up to 10 characters long. Supplying the file with those pragma statements gets arround that limitation and namemap will do the tedious work of creating those files. This can save a lot of time when porting large aplications. |
